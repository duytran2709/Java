/**
 * Chapter5_16
 * (Bar Chart Printing Program) 
 * One interesting application of computers is to display graphs and bar charts. 
 * Write an application that reads five numbers between 1 and 30. 
 * For each number thatâ€™s read, your program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks. 
 * For exam- ple, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******. 
 * Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers.
